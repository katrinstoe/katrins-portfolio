	description="As part of the Programming Course Interface Development, our team developed a gamified barista-themed learning platform featuring an educational game and a backend authoring tool. The project aimed to help future baristas learn coffee ingredients interactively while enabling content management through a custom-built backend. My contributions included designing the websiteâ€™s UI, implementing the Level 1 memory game, and assisting in backend development. Through collaborative problem-solving and iterative testing, we delivered a fully functional platform, achieving top marks. To explore the full project and its development process, click below."
