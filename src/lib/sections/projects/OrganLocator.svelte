	title="Interactive Organ Locator"
	description="This project was developed for the Multimodal Interaction and Interfaces course. It features an Augmented Reality (AR) application that helps users locate human organs interactively using audio and haptic feedback. The app was tested in a user study with 24 participants to evaluate immersion and usability. My contributions included app development, user testing, data analysis, and research writing.
