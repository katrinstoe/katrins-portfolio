	description="This project was created during the Selected Areas of Psychology course at the University of WÃ¼rzburg. It features an educational video explaining the Big Five personality traits through engaging visuals and polished editing. My contributions included designing custom illustrations, editing the video using Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, and collaborating on content development. This project combined technical skills in video production with psychological insights to communicate complex concepts effectively. To learn more about the design process and insights, click below."
