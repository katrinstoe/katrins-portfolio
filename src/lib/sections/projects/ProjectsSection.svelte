			The project section contains a collection of projects that I have completed during my studies
			at university or during internships at companies. These projects cover a wide range of fields,
			including ux research, programming, and design. In this section, you can find my most recent
			examples of work and see how I have applied my skills and knowledge to tackle a variety of
			challenges. Whether you are looking for inspiration, or just want to learn more about my
			experiences as a university student, the project section has something for everyone. So be
			sure to check it out!
